Fix for "time and date" routine.

  This problem resulted from my first fix, it seems.

  I found that the execution time for the program was being
  reported wrong.  So instead of fixing the WKDATE routine, I
  replaced it with a routine that I knew was working correctly.
  This was the TODAY routine, which I lifted from the TAPEMAP
  program on CBT Tape File 299.

  Actually, the TODAY routine also reports the Julian date, which
  the WKDATE routine didn't report.  So there's an improvement.

Fix for S0C8 problem with long tapes.

  In making a CBT Tape with 6250 bpi measurement, when the tape
  was longer than 19750 feet or so, the program bombed with a
  S0C8 abend.  This was caused by an SPM instruction in the
  $ENTER macro, which caused the abend when 31 bits of the fullword
  field CUMTOTAL overflowed into the 32nd bit (bit 0).  To stop the
  abend, the $ENTER macro was re-coded with SPM=NO as its default.
  This eliminated the SPM instructions, and stopped SPM from
  causing the abend.

  As a further note, I had copied all the footage measuring code
  from this program into my modifications of the COPYMODS program
  (CBT Files 299, 847) and there was no S0C8 abend there.  The
  difference turned out to be that I had not copied Gordon's $ENTER
  and $RTRN macros, but I had used my own Assembler housekeeping.
  Turns out that made all the difference.

Fix to eliminate ABENDs produced by the SS0104 program.

  In order to fix abends caused by fixed-point overflow exceptions,
  we had to code "SPM=NO" instead of "SPF=YES" in the $ENTER and
  $RTRN macros.

  In order to eliminate the user abends produced by the porgram
  SS0104 when it encountered I/O errors, we changed the two lines
  at label "ABEND" as follows:

*BEND    ABEND 1001,DUMP               GET A DUMP
*        B     HOPE
ABEND    B     EOV                     END SMOOTHLY INSTEAD OF DUMPING
         SPACE
*--------DCB ABEND ROUTINE

  Problem fixed, Dec. 20, 2023.
